### Navigation

This app is divided into three parts. On the first tab you will find a demo of a Google search result React component, displaying title, rul, and description props. On the second tab, you'll find a web sraper that takes a URL and returns the title of the website. Enable CORS to use this feature. On the third tab, you'll find a React configurable table component. The table is configurable from withing the component itself, and accepts rows, columns, and filters. You can also delete columns.
